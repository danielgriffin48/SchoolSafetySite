# School Safety Site
## A prototype campaign website to give road safety campaginers the data they need to make roads safety
This project started after a failed information request from an MP about the number of road accidents outside of schools. In their response to the MP the Department for Transport simply said they although they have a lot of detailed data, they have no variable that tracks accidents outside of schools. 


## Aim
The aim of this project is simple - to give campaigners a tool to find road safety data - the facts and figures that politicians and local authorities cannot easily get access to and make it so that this can be used to put pressure on decision makers to improve safety.

At present the site is a prototype to help find a partner organisation to develop the site further. The data could very easily form the basis of a campaign to highlight the schools / constituencies / local authorities most in need of improvement.
